# VDFQuery20

VDFQuery library for DataFlex 20.0 and later.

... is the old VDFQuery library ported to DF20. Only to help migrate legacy applications to DF20.

This library has been migrated to DF 20 in order to assist in migrating legacy
applications that uses (older versions of) VDFQuery.

The library contains a lot of outdated code that does not at all reflect how
the dataflex language is used in 2021.

If you are new to VDFQuery you should keep it so. Look for more modern libraries
